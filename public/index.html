          <h2><span>The History</span> of Our Hotel</h2>
          <p>
            Hotels go back to ancient times. Not in the way we know them, but
            right back to the early days of civilisation. In those days there
            were places where you exchange money or goods for a roof over your
            head for the night. This was especially important at this time
            because journeys were taken by foot (or horse, later), so getting
            places took much longer than it does now. While this matches the
            concept of a hotel as we know it, it was often just a in somebodys
            home. Often it was actually an outhouse! At this point, hotels were
            somewhere to stay out of necessity as part of a journey rather than
            somewhere to make a journey to. However, savvy ancient business men
            realised this was something they could expand on. In the Ancient
            Roman times, society to see more of what we would equate todays
            hotels. Hospitia, derived from the word hospitality, was used to
            describe rooms rented in private homes, as explained above. Over
            time these were commercialised. The hospitia started to offer food
            and drink as well as somewhere to sleep, and became somewhere that
            people would travel to for relaxation and holiday purposes the upper
            classes, that is! One example is the House of Sallust.
