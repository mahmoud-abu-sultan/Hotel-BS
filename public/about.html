          This was especially important at this time because journeys were taken
          by foot (or horse, later), so getting places took much longer than it
          does now. While this matches the concept of a hotel as we know it, it
          was often just a in somebodys home. Often it was actually an outhouse!
          At this point, hotels were somewhere to stay out of necessity as part
          of a journey rather than somewhere to make a journey to. However,
          savvy ancient business men realised this was something they could
          expand on. In the Ancient Roman times, society to see more of what we
          would equate todays hotels. Hospitia, derived from the word
          hospitality, was used to describe rooms rented in private homes, as
          explained above. Over time these were commercialised. The hospitia
          started to offer food and drink as well as somewhere to sleep, and
          became somewhere that people would travel to for relaxation and
          holiday purposes the upper classes, that is! One example is the House
          of Sallust.
